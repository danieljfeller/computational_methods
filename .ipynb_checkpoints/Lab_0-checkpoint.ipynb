    "## 0.1 Install Anaconda\n",
    "The python programming language is ubiquitous in data science, and it certaintly comes with its caveats. There are many modules available for python which extend its functionality, but installing them so they don't fight with each other can sometimes be a challenge. In this course, Python 3.6 will be the official version of python, and all modules used for labs will be installed through Anaconda. Anaconda is a package management tool that is very useful for handling different python and module versions. If, for example, you need to use python 3.7 for another project, a conda environment will keep it working on your computer without conflicting with the modules used in this course. Before the first lab, please download [Anaconda 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for whatever system you use (Mac, PC, or Linux) and create an environment called `Computational_methods`, by opening a terminal and running the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name Computational_methods -python=3.6`\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a directory where you will save your labs (I'm calling mine `CM_S19`), save `Lab_0.ipynb` in the directory, then navigate to the directory from a terminal. Activate your new environment by running `source activate Computational_methods` (or just `activate Computational_methods` on Windows). Your terminal should now look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(Computational_methods) jonah@spectre-x360:~/CM_S19$`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you run `python`, your computer will look for the version in the `Computational_methods` directory, and not the one that in your global path. To see where python is, type `which python`. Now deactivate the environment by running `source deactivate`, and locate python again. What is the difference?"

    "All of our labs will be done through Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is a great tool for keeping your work organized, and for making your code more readable. Fortunately, it comes in the box with Anaconda! Jupyter plays nice with conda environments, but in order for it to recognize packages you install in your `Computational_methods` environment, you must install a new python kernel from the environment's version of python. To do this, activate your `Computational_methods` environment again, and run:\n",

Now, run `jupyter notebook`, and click the URL to open Jupyter program in your preferred browser. Once Jupyter is running, you can now open `Lab_0.pynb` from the Jupyter dashboard. If you can't find it, navigate to the directory where you save downloads in the terminal, then re run `jupyter notebook`.\n",
